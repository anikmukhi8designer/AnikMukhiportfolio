This tablet would serve as the central control system for entertainment, hospitality, and service requests throughout the game. My role was to design the complete user experience and user interface, starting from the foundational wireframes and evolving into the final high-fidelity screens. The goal was to create an elegant, intuitive digital companion that matched the luxury environment of the suite while making guest interactions faster and more enjoyable."

The final experience had to feel fast, visually engaging, and easy to navigate in the middle of an exciting match."

Each path was designed to minimize steps and offer clear, guided actions. For example, ordering food allows users to browse categories, customize items, and confirm orders in a smooth sequence without leaving their seat. Similarly, TV controls offer fast toggles for switching between live match, highlights, movies, and news."
